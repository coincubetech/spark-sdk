//! Mainnet cross-chain itests (env-gated).
//!
//! Exercises both directions against the funded test account ("Alice") on Spark
//! and a **deterministic EVM wallet derived from the same test mnemonic** at
//! `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`. All tests target **Arbitrum One**, the only chain
//! offering USD-stable assets on both providers.
//!
//! ## Send tests (Alice → EVM)
//!
//! - `test_cross_chain_01_usdt_send_fees_excluded_evm`: BTC (sats) → USDT.
//!   Provider is selectable via `MAINNET_TEST_CROSS_CHAIN_SEND_USDT_PROVIDER`
//!   (`orchestra` default, `boltz` alternative) so the USDT stash keeps
//!   getting produced when one provider is temporarily down.
//! - `test_cross_chain_02_orchestra_send_fees_excluded_evm`: USDB → USDC via Orchestra.
//!
//! Verifies receipt independently by reading the EVM recipient's ERC-20 balance
//! over JSON-RPC. Both exercise the fees-excluded / target-overpay guarantee.
//!
//! ## Receive tests (EVM → Alice)
//!
//! Each receive test is paired with a send test so the pool an itest pass
//! drains gets refilled by its counterpart, keeping Alice's Spark-side
//! balances roughly conservative across runs:
//!
//! - `test_cross_chain_03_orchestra_receive_fees_excluded_evm`: **USDT → BTC
//!   (sats)**. Alice targets a small USD amount (in USDB base units). The SDK
//!   converts it to sats via the live BTC/USD rate before sizing the USDT
//!   deposit. Counters test 01 so the sats Alice spent to build the USDT
//!   stash come back here. Also exercises the receive branch where the USDB
//!   rounding margin is NOT applied (BTC destination).
//! - `test_cross_chain_04_orchestra_receive_fees_excluded_usdb_evm`: **USDC →
//!   USDB**, fees-excluded. Alice targets a small USD amount. The SDK sizes
//!   the USDC deposit with the USDB rounding margin so delivered lands at or
//!   above target. This is the receive branch where the rounding margin IS
//!   applied.
//! - `test_cross_chain_05_orchestra_receive_fees_included_evm`: **USDC →
//!   USDB**. Sweep the EVM wallet's remaining USDC balance back into Alice's
//!   Spark wallet as USDB. Counters test 02 so the USDB Alice spent to build
//!   the USDC stash comes back here.
//!
//! Receive tests need Arbitrum ETH at the deterministic EVM address to pay gas
//! for the ERC-20 transfer. The tests read the balance and skip loudly (never
//! hard-fail) if it's below the threshold. Roadmap: when a second cross-chain
//! receive provider ships, one of these should switch to that provider so both
//! providers get exercised in a single run.
//!
//! ## Test ordering
//!
//! Tests are name-prefixed `01_`…`05_` and run in that order under
//! `--test-threads=1` (libtest sorts tests alphabetically). Ordering matters:
//! each send test deposits its destination asset at the EVM recipient, and
//! the three receive tests then consume those balances. Test 03 uses the USDT
//! from test 01. Tests 04 and 05 share the USDC pool from test 02: test 04
//! takes a $1 slice first, then test 05 sweeps whatever's left.
//!
//! NOTE: the cross-chain `amount` semantics depend on both the fee mode and
//! the test direction. See [`ReceivePaymentMethod::CrossChain::amount`] and
//! [`PaymentRequest::CrossChain::amount`] for the full contract.
//!
//! # Required environment variables
//! - `MAINNET_TEST_MNEMONIC`: mnemonic of the funded test account. Primary gate.
//! - `BREEZ_API_KEY`: API key the mainnet SDK requires.
//!
//! # Optional
//! - `MAINNET_TEST_TOKEN_ID`: USD-stable source token. Defaults to USDB.
//! - `MAINNET_TEST_CROSS_CHAIN_SEND_USDB`: Orchestra send source in USDB base
//!   units (6-decimals). Defaults to 2_500_000 (2.50 USDB, ~$2.50 USDC
//!   delivered). Sized to feed both test 04 (fees-excluded slice) and test
//!   05 (sweep) off a single pool.
//! - `MAINNET_TEST_CROSS_CHAIN_SEND_SATS`: BTC → USDT send source in **sats**.
//!   Defaults to 1_500 (~$1.50 USDT delivered). Sized to leave a bit above
//!   what the fees-excluded receive test consumes each pass.
//! - `MAINNET_TEST_CROSS_CHAIN_RECEIVE_USDB_TARGET`: fees-excluded receive
//!   target in USDB base units (6dp). Applies to tests 03 and 04.
//!   Defaults to `1_000_000` ($1). For test 03 (BTC destination) the SDK
//!   converts USD to sats at prepare time via the live BTC/USD rate.
//! - `MAINNET_TEST_CROSS_CHAIN_RECEIVE_USDC_MAX`: cap for the fees-included
//!   USDC sweep, in USDC base units. Unset by default (sweep the full
//!   balance).
//! - `MAINNET_TEST_CROSS_CHAIN_SEND_USDT_PROVIDER`: selects the provider for
//!   the BTC → USDT send in test 01. `orchestra` (default) exercises the
//!   Spark-funded direct transfer. `boltz` exercises the Lightning-funded
//!   reverse swap. Values are case-insensitive. Unknown values fall back to
//!   Orchestra with a warning.
//!
//! # Precondition for the receive tests
//! The EVM address at `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0` needs a small Arbitrum ETH balance for
//! gas (~0.00005 ETH is plenty for a single ERC-20 transfer). Top up manually
//! when needed. Tests skip when it's short.
//!
//! # Run locally
//! ```bash
