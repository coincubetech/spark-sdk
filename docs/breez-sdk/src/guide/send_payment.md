# Sending payments

Once the SDK is initialized, you can directly begin sending payments. The send process takes two steps:

1. [Preparing the Payment](send_payment.md#preparing-payments)
2. [Sending the Payment](send_payment.md#sending-payments)

For sending payments via LNURL, see [LNURL-Pay](lnurl_pay.md).

    <a class="tag" target="_blank" href="https://breez.github.io/spark-sdk/breez_sdk_spark/struct.BreezSdk.html#method.prepare_send_payment">API docs</a>
</h2>

During the prepare step, the SDK ensures that the inputs are valid with respect to the payment request type,
and also returns the fees related to the payment so they can be confirmed.

The payment request field supports Lightning invoices, Bitcoin addresses, Spark addresses and Spark invoices.

<h4>Developer note</h4>
Payments can be sent without holding Bitcoin by converting on-the-fly as a step before sending a payment. See <a href="./token_conversion.md">Converting tokens</a> for more information.

### Lightning

#### BOLT11 invoice

For BOLT11 invoices the amount can be optionally set. It is only required if the invoice doesn't specify an amount. If the invoice specifies an amount, providing a different amount is not supported.

If the invoice also contains a Spark address, the payment can be sent directly via a Spark transfer instead. When this is the case, the prepare response includes the Spark transfer fee. Note that only one fee is paid: either the Lightning fee or the Spark transfer fee, depending on which payment method is ultimately used. See [Lightning](send_payment.md#lightning-1) for how to select the payment method.

{{#tabs send_payment:prepare-send-payment-lightning-bolt11}}

### Bitcoin

For Bitcoin addresses, the amount must be set in the request. The prepare response includes fee quotes for three payment speeds: Slow, Medium, and Fast.

The quote's {{#name is_estimate}} flag is set when your bitcoin balance is zero and a token conversion will fund the payment, which happens automatically when [Stable Balance](./stable_balance.md) is active. The fees shown are then derived from current on-chain rates rather than quoted by the provider, so the real ones may differ. They are an upper bound: the SDK fetches a real quote once the conversion completes, and fails rather than spending more than it estimated. Present this as an estimate if you show it.

Fee quotes are short lived. If one is close to expiry by the time you send, the SDK fetches a fresh quote for you. It will not spend more than the payment allows, so a fee that rises beyond that fails the send and asks you to prepare again.

{{#tabs send_payment:prepare-send-payment-onchain}}

### Spark

#### Spark address

For Spark addresses, the amount must be set in the request. Sending to a Spark address uses a direct Spark transfer.

{{#tabs send_payment:prepare-send-payment-spark-address}}

#### Spark invoice

For Spark invoices, the amount can be optionally set. It is only required if the invoice doesn't specify an amount. If the invoice specifies an amount, providing a different amount is not supported.

<div class="warning">
<h4>Developer note</h4>
Spark invoices may require a token (non-Bitcoin) as the payment asset. To determine the requirements of a Spark invoice and any restrictions it may impose, see the <a href="./parse.md">Parsing inputs</a> page. To learn more about tokens, see the <a href="./tokens.md">Handling tokens</a> page.

<h3 id="usdc-usdt">
    <a class="header" href="#usdc-usdt">USDC/USDT</a>
</h3>

Send USDC or USDT from a Spark wallet to a recipient on one of several supported chains: Ethereum-family chains (Arbitrum, Base, and similar EVM networks), Solana, and Tron. The source on the Spark side is BTC sats or [USDB](./stable_balance.md) (a 6-decimal USD-pegged token on Spark). This feature must be enabled in [the SDK configuration](./config.md#usdc-usdt) before using. See [USDC/USDT](./cross_chain.md) for provider details and the status lifecycle.

After [parsing](./parse.md) the recipient address into {{#enum InputType::CrossChainAddress}}, call {{#name get_cross_chain_routes}} with {{#enum CrossChainRouteFilter::Send}} carrying the parsed {{#name CrossChainAddressDetails}}. The returned {{#name CrossChainRoutePair}}s name the provider, destination chain and asset, decimals, optional token contract address, and which Spark-side assets (BTC sats or USDB) each route accepts, with the amount bounds published for each. See [Amount limits](./cross_chain.md#amount-limits) for how to read the bounds and what they do and do not guarantee.

{{#tabs cross_chain:cross-chain-get-routes}}

Build {{#enum PaymentRequest::CrossChain}} with the recipient address, the chosen route, and an optional {{#name max_slippage_bps}} (10 to 500 basis points). The amount on the prepare request is denominated in the source asset's base units: sats for a BTC source, USDB base units for a USDB source.

The prepare response carries a quote {{#name expires_at}} timestamp. Re-prepare and pick a fresh route if it lapses before send.

{{#tabs cross_chain:cross-chain-prepare}}

## Fee Policy

By default, fees are added on top of the amount ({{#enum FeePolicy::FeesExcluded}}). Use {{#enum FeePolicy::FeesIncluded}} to deduct fees from the amount instead—the receiver gets the amount minus fees.

This is particularly useful when you want to spend your entire balance in a single payment—simply provide your full balance as the amount. Note: {{#enum FeePolicy::FeesIncluded}} is not compatible with payment requests that specify an amount (e.g., BOLT11 invoices and Spark invoices with amount).

{{#tabs send_payment:prepare-send-payment-fees-included}}

When [stable balance](./stable_balance.md) is active, you can send your entire wallet balance — both the token balance and any remaining sats — by combining {{#enum FeePolicy::FeesIncluded}} with {{#enum ConversionType::ToBitcoin}} conversion options. See [Sending entire balance](./stable_balance.md#sending-entire-balance) for details.

</h2>

Once the payment has been prepared and the fees are accepted, the payment can be sent by passing:

- **Prepare Response** - The response from the [Preparing the Payment](send_payment.md#preparing-payments) step.
- **Options** - Any payment method specific options for the payment (see below).
- **Idempotency Key** - An optional UUID that identifies the payment. If set, providing the same idempotency key for multiple requests will ensure that only one payment is made.

### Lightning

In the optional send payment options for BOLT11 invoices, you can set:

- **Prefer Spark** - Set the preference to use Spark to transfer the payment if the invoice contains a Spark address. By default, using Spark transfers are disabled.
- **Completion Timeout** - By default, this function returns immediately. You can override this behavior by specifying a completion timeout in seconds. If the timeout is reached, a pending payment object is returned. If the payment completes within the timeout, the completed payment object is returned.

{{#tabs send_payment:send-payment-lightning-bolt11}}

### Bitcoin

In the optional send payment options for Bitcoin addresses, you can set:

- **Confirmation Speed** - The priority that the Bitcoin transaction confirms, that also effects the fee paid. By default, it is set to Fast.

{{#tabs send_payment:send-payment-onchain}}

### Spark

In the optional send payment options for Spark addresses, you can set:

- **HTLC Options** - Enables Spark HTLC payments, which are an advanced feature that allows for conditional payments. See the [Spark HTLC Payments](htlcs.md) page for more details and example usage.

Send USDC/USDT has no additional send payment options.

## Event Flows

Once a send payment is initiated, you can follow and react to the different payment events using the guide below for each payment method. See [listening to events](/guide/events.html) for how to subscribe to events. 

The {{#enum SdkEvent::Synced}} event is also emitted as the SDK syncs in the background. See [fetching the balance](/guide/get_info.md) for the recommended pattern for refreshing the balance and payments list.
